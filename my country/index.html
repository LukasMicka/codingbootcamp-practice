    <h1 class="the-text">About the Czech capital - Prague</h1>
    <p>Situated in the northwest of the country on the Vltava River, Prague is the capital and the largest city of the Czech Republic. 
        This magical city of bridges, cathedrals, gold-tipped towers and church spires is also the fourteenth largest city in the European Union. 
        The city is home to about 1.3 million people, but its larger urban zone has approximately a population of nearly 2 million. 
        Since the Middle Ages Prague has cherished the reputation of one of the most beautiful cities in the world as well as the political, cultural,
         and economic center of central Europe.</p>
